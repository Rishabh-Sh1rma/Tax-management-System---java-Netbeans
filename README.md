It provides users with a detailed view of allowances & deductions, helping taxpayers optimize savings and gain a clearer understanding of their finances.. The project is backed by a SQL database managed through XAMPP, ensuring secure and efficient data handling. The system provides a user-friendly interface for managing various types of income, investments, and allowances, while also offering robust security features such as password management and email verification via OTP.
